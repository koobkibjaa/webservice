// The outbox relay — the sole consumer of the shared `events` table. Started once from
// instrumentation.js as setInterval(runRelayOnce, 1000); also exported so tests can drain it
// synchronously. Every domain event is claimed exactly once (processed_at) before dispatch, so a
// second pass over the same event is a no-op — the relay is idempotent.
//
// THE rating aggregate is recomputed HERE, driven by the review.created event, never inline in the
// review handler. That is the deliberate eventual-consistency contrast the course teaches.
